In 2021 there were 6.6 million electric vehicles sold worldwide and, this year, that number is expected to rise to 10.5 million. Global laptop sales are projected to fall slightly, from 277 million last year to 272 million in 2025. Figures like these are the result of in-depth research and, in many cases, are based on actual data reported directly by the sectors' major players.

Yet we have no clear industry consensus of how many bitcoin mining machines will be sold this year - not even how many were sold last year. The bitcoin mining hardware sector is new on the radar of mainstream financial analysts and the major players do not always openly report sales volumes. A more nuanced approach is needed to estimate the size of the market. Rather than taking a bottom-up approach - trying to stitch together as much of the opaque sales information as we can from what is provided by manufacturers - we can instead resort to the most transparent information source of all: the bitcoin blockchain.

Starting from the most general and narrowing in, let's take a top-down approach to reasoning. Using bitcoin's network hashrate as a proxy measure for the number of machines on the network, accompanied by data-derived assumptions about the characteristics of those machines, we can calculate an approximation for the size of the bitcoin mining hardware market. What we learn in the process will allow us to generate projections about its future.
