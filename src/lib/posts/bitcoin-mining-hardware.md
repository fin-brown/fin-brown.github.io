Many extended discussions have charted the progressions of nearly every conceivable performance metric - most centered around hashrate and efficiency. These metrics have been analyzed in-depth and from every angle. There are chipâ€™s-eye view reports on how the underlying technologies developed that extend from the first block mined to present day, with each milestone recognized en route.
